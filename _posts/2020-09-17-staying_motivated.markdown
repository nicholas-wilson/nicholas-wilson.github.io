Motivation is something that countless people struggle with when it comes to learning a new skill. This may be because they are not able to get the results they hoped for right away and start to realize that acquiring this skill will require a lot of actual effort. Now something they may not realize is that this effort can be spread over years and doesn't have to be all at once. For those who do seem to get caught up in the overwhelming amount of work required, you might just need to do a bit of planning in order to gain back that motivation.

Making a plan might even seem like a challenge to some, but this plan should be so simple that you have no excuse not to follow it. If the skill is programming, something like making a plan that says "watch 1 programming related video before bed" can help to build a habit related to the skill and regain motivation. The big idea here is to make this new skill a part of your life by making sure that you do something related to the skill every day.

Once you are consistently dedicating time to a skill, you may still face demotivation when your ability isn't living up to expectations. When this happens, it may be useful to start keeping track of your progress by recording yourself while working on this skill, maybe do this once a week. Now by the time you finish your recording the next week, just rewatch the previous week's video and you can compare the difference in skill and see improvement. If one weeks time you don't notice much improvement, consider looking back an entire month. This constant reminder that you are actually improving and moving in the right direction can be very motivational and ensure that progress in the right direction is being made.

While making sure to dedicate time to this skill is important, making sure to dedicate time away from the skill can also be very beneficial. If you decide to put all of your spare time into learning the skill everyday of the week, this most likely won't be sustainable long term and can lead to burnout and demotivation as well. Making sure to add in a simple, 5 minute stretch or water breaks once an hour could be enough to clear your thoughts and help productivity. It could also be the case that you need to cut down to 3 hours of that skill and spend 1 or 2 hours with family or friends, so that you can relieve some stress.

Overall these are just a few general suggestions and ideas on how to stay motivated. Motivation will vary from person to person and some people will be more tolerant with their progress than others. Really the key to staying motivated is finding the balance between spending too little time to make progress and spending too much time to the point where you no longer want to work on the skill. As long as you make the skill a constant part of your life, you can continue to improve until you reach that level of skill you thought of initially, but if you decide to stop your ability to improve that skill will also.
