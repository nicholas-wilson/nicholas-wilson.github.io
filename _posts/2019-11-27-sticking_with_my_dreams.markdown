Hello, my name is Nicholas Wilson and until recently I had no idea what I should be doing. I've been working a part time job for a few years and living my life day by day, which was great for a while but then the realization came that I want to be creating a career for myself and not just coast along. I spent a lot of time thinking about what I should be doing in the future, even enrolled in some community college classes to see if there was a field out there that would suit me. Most of the classes were interesting but not something I could see myself moving towards, until I took an Intro to Programming class. That was when I remembered my young dreams of becoming a video game programmer.

When I was a child I was asked numerous times in school what I wanted to be when I grew up, every single time I've been asked that question I responded with the exact same answer every single time. I wanted to be a Video Game Programmer. As a kid I didn't know anything about programming or what studying it would entail, but I recognized the greatness and massive potential that people who can program are capable of creating.

Video games seemed to always be frowned upon by society because there was this stigma that persons who played a lot of video games would become stupid or ignorant, but I could never understand this mindset. So many video games require the player to use their brain to solve puzzles or riddles and even use a lot of vocabulary that kids end up learning while doing something that is fun! I have learned so much from different video games over the years even the valuable skill of working together as a team from games like League of Legends and Overwatch. The people who program video games are definitely productive members within society and influence the next generation.

As someone who wants to have a positive contribution to society, I know that I need to work hard so that I am able to help out someone in the future like the programmers of the past have helped me. When I took my first programming class I soon realized just how much effort is needed to learn programming and I had to go into my professors office hours every single week in order to understand the concepts. It definitely started out rough, but sticking with it and persevering I found the challenge that came with programming extremely enjoyable. There isn't anything else that I want to do for a career in life besides becoming a software programmer, I have all the reasons to go out and help the next generation with the beauty that is computer software and video games!
