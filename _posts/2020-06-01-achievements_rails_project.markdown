Once again creating a project starts with the brainstorming and with the Rails project it was a lot tougher than expected. At first, coming up with an idea seemed easy as there aren't really many restrictions. The big problem was that as the idea was developed more it became more clear that the idea wasn't going to fit the ActiveRecord model relation requirements. After half developing about 4 or 5 ideas, came a realization that people tend to enjoy point-based achievement systems and that if people were able to create their own achievements they would be more likely to work towards a goal. Luckily this idea checked all the requirements and seemed like something that could really be useful.

After a day or two of planning on the whiteboard, the madness of starting from nothing begins once more. After dealing with this two other times, it was actually not so bad this time. Bringing up a few stackoverflow posts and referring back to the mapped out plan of the project, starting is pretty simple. Making sure to add the project with "rails new" and adding gems was first. Since the application has users and requires third-party login, the gems "omniauth" and "omniauth-facebook" were a must. The gem "bcrypt" is also a great gem that is used to verify logins and that users' passwords are safe in the database. The other part of starting up the Achievement Tracker was to create models and start up the database.

Models are very important in this project and in general, but don't worry too much about how they are initially stuctured. Over the course of creating this project the models were changed, the associations were changed, the tables were changed in the database, and they were all changed more than once. The good thing is that nothing has to be set in stone and changes are easy to implement most of the time. Changes to code can be scary or frustrating but it is a lot easier to continue progressing if you've built something and can test it, than if you try to theory-craft all the nitty-gritty details or issues that might come up. Some may say that planning a project out all the way will make the developement go a lot smoother, but if the person creating the project gets too stuck on details and gets discouraged easily, going forward with an intial plan and working out the kinks will be more beneficial.

Achievements are also something that are not usually done all at once. Achievements are supposed to be little side goals that are completed over time while working towards something bigger, just like a project. Making sure to check off the project requirements as they were completed and looking at what was still left to do was a very good way to keep on top of things. Without completing those little achievements, it would be a lot harder to stay on track and make sure that the project included nested routes or that Facebook login was actually implemented and not just an empty skeleton.

Overall this project wasn't the first idea or potentially not even the best idea that could have been formed, but it is a concept that could really help people be more productive. Productivity isn't everything, but for people who have a hard time getting things accomplished, it can be nice to complete goals more reliably and in a fun manner. Creating goals is a great thing, but having stepping stones along the way will make it possible to reach those goals.
